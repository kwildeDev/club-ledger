## ðŸ§¾ ClubLedger

### Overview

**ClubLedger** is a lightweight bookkeeping web app for small clubs and community organisations.  
It replaces spreadsheet-based accounts with an easy-to-use web interface for single-entry bookkeeping, keeping the simplicity of Excel while adding structure, reporting, and export to spreadsheet format.

This project is being developed as a solo MVP to test and refine the concept.
